### About us  
**Baracubaba** is a collective of friends and colleagues passionate about creating, learning, and sharing knowledge. Our team consists mainly of developers, but we welcome collaboration from people of all backgrounds. The best ideas come when diverse minds work together.

### What we do  
We build websites, mobile apps, game mods—especially for Minecraft, using technologies like [NeoForge](https://neoforged.net/)—and any other open-source concept that sparks our curiosity.

### Mission  
Our primary mission is to share knowledge freely. Every project we create serves as both a practical tool and an educational resource. We believe education should be accessible to everyone, so most of our resources are completely free.

### Tools and Workflow  
We strongly encourage using tools like **Obsidian** and **Excalidraw** to help organize ideas and make learning easier. Each of our projects comes with clear documentation, ensuring the community can easily understand and use them.

### Licensing and Collaborations  
All projects at Baracubaba use GPL licenses (or their variations depending on the project). While we don't directly sell our work, we encourage individual or collective collaborations. If any project catches your eye, feel free to contact us directly.

We're always open for a conversation!
