**Baracubaba** is a collective of friends brimming with ideas and a passion for learning and bringing them to life. Our portfolio is diverse, encompassing everything from websites, mobile apps, and Minecraft mods (Forge) to any open-source concept we can envision. Our team isn't just made up of developers. Here's a breakdown of our current members and their roles:

- [Luiz-AVcruz](https://github.com/Luiz-AVcruz)  - Organizer, QA, and Developer | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luiz-augusto-vitorino-cruz/)
- [Dan](https://github.com/dan-brbb) - Developer
- **ParadoxREDO** - General Helper and Developer Apprentice

All of our projects come with a README that explains what the project is about, its technical specifications, and other details such as our future plans. It's worth noting that while GitHub serves as a showcase for our repositories, we primarily use [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/) for our project management, where most of our projects will also be made public.
