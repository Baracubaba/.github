**Baracubaba** is a collective of friends brimming with ideas and a passion for learning and bringing them to life. Our portfolio is diverse, encompassing everything from websites, mobile apps, and Minecraft mods with [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/) to any open-source concept we can envision. Our team isn't just made up of developers. Here's a breakdown of our current members and their roles:

We are not just about innovation and execution, our core drive is to create projects that also serve as free educational resources for users. We believe in the power of knowledge sharing and are committed to providing quality information at no cost. This ethos of learning and sharing underpins every project we undertake, as we strive to contribute to a community where education is accessible to everyone. Our hope is that our work not only fulfills practical needs but also enriches the learning journey of all who come across it.

All of our projects come with a README that explains what the project is about, its technical specifications, and other details such as our future plans. It's worth noting that while GitHub serves as a showcase for our repositories, we primarily use [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/) for our project management and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)/[Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) for our roadmaps/wiki, where most of our projects will also be made public.
